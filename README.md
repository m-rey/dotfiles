# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. They are used on a system running openSUSE Tumbleweed and are managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

Install them with:
`chezmoi init "github.com/m-rey/dotfiles"`

## TODO
While the dotfiles work, there are some small issues and suggestions that could be fixed/implemented. I've created [issues](https://github.com/m-rey/dotfiles/issues) for them.

## Contributing
For any questions, comments, feedback or issues, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/szorfein/dots/issues/new).

Feel free to submit a PR if you know how to resolve an issue or just want to contribute an improvement.
